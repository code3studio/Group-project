#### Task Distribution:
During our first team meeting, we assigned responsibilities as follows:

1. **Part I (Nicholas Tantalean):**
   •	Designed and implemented the First-Fit and Next-Fit memory allocation algorithms.
	•	Integrated allocation logic into the main simulation loop.
	•	Collaborated on code testing.

2. **Part II (Sebastian Acosta):**
	•	Documented all memory block/hole structures and address manipulation.
	•	Wrote detailed inline code comments and the final report.
	•	Assembled and finalized README and presentation/demo materials.

3. **Part III (Christopher Paladines):**
	•	Developed the simulation control logic (iteration, utilization tracking, failure detection).
	•	Handled data collection for memory utilization and average holes examined.
	•	Created visualizations and formatted final data outputs (e.g., tables/graphs if required).

4. **Part IV (Aldo Vega):**
	•	Designed and implemented the Best-Fit and Worst-Fit memory allocation algorithms.
	•	Optimized hole-search strategy and ensured accurate coalescing during releases.
	•	Worked on simulation parameter integration and randomized request/release logic.

#### Completed Work:
Before submission, we verified that each team member successfully completed their assigned tasks:

- Nicholas Tantalean:
  •	Fully implemented and tested First-Fit and Next-Fit strategies. ✅
  •	Ensured proper request satisfaction and error handling in allocation functions. ✅

- Sebastian Acosta:
  •	Completed documentation of simulation logic and memory structure.✅
  •	Prepared final report, cleaned and commented codebase, and created README.✅

- Christopher Paladines:
  •	Controlled simulation logic for all four parameter sets.✅
  •	Calculated and recorded average memory utilization and number of holes examined.✅
  
- Aldo Vega:
  •	Completed Best-Fit and Worst-Fit algorithms with proper memory scanning logic.✅
  •	Verified coalescing of neighboring holes after release operations.✅
